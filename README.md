Abstract. Human society has evolved through various stages including primitive tribal societies, slave societies, feudal societies, capitalist societies, and socialist societies. These changes fundamentally stem from advancements in productivity and changes in production relations. Currently, AI is rapidly developing, propelling human productivity to another level. The impending fourth industrial revolution will alter the existing economic, political, and cultural paradigms, often leading to significant societal upheaval. We propose a new development theory, tentatively termed as the public ownership of large industrial systems, the decentralization of production materials to the proletariat, and the limitation of private ownership in daily life sectors with AI robots replacing labor. This theory aims to facilitate this industrial revolution through peaceful evolution, mitigating disasters and tragedies. We hope that through this industrial revolution, everyone can satisfy their material needs without oppression or exploitation, fostering freedom and comprehensive development for all. The shift in societal values from a singular profit-driven focus to a diverse value system will enable individuals to prioritize spiritual fulfillment over material desires, gradually guiding humanity towards a communist society.
Keywords: AI Robots, Productivity, Social Systems, Communism


1.A Tremendous Crisis
The third industrial revolution, centered around computers and atomic energy, has matured after more than half a century of development. Production management systems and automation technologies have increased production efficiency. Leading capitalist countries, particularly the United States, have entered the stage of financial capital, marking the pinnacle of capitalism's exploitation of humans. The current urban landscape and the living conditions of the proletariat in the United States serve as the best evidence of this fact.
The relocation of industries by the United States to other countries is not only due to the higher efficiency of financial capital in extracting profits but also hides another reason. Industrial production in capitalist societies often leads to overproduction, triggering cyclical economic crises. Relocating industries reduces the risk of overproduction. From the perspective of countries accepting industrial transfers, it helps develop their own industries, improve productivity, but also carries the risk of economic crises due to accepting low-end manufacturing.
China and the United States are the two strongest economies globally. The United States boasts the strongest financial capital, while China possesses the most robust industrial strength globally. Facing the downturn of the economic cycle, the world economy is transitioning from the third industrial revolution to the fourth industrial revolution. For the United States, the crisis primarily arises from dollar liabilities and the decline in its global discourse power, weakening its ability to recoup through colonialism. The resulting economic crisis may be more severe than any in history. For China, U.S. insistence on decoupling and trade wars may lead to domestic overproduction. If not resolved promptly, this overproduction may lead to an economic crisis.
In 2023, AI and robots experienced significant development. AI robots can replace human cognition in labor production, presenting a tool for achieving super automation. However, a tremendous crisis arises from this development. Any tool that enhances productivity will first be adopted by enterprises, which are mostly privately owned. The core demand of privately owned enterprises is capital appreciation. Therefore, it is foreseeable that when the cost of using AI robots becomes lower than human labor costs, a singularity where AI robots massively replace labor will occur. Countless enterprises will begin using AI robots for production activities, leading to a growing unemployed population and a sudden increase in the proletariat.
Economic crises disrupt the normal operation of the economy, while AI robots accelerate this crisis, exacerbating the contradictions between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. If this crisis erupts, it may spread from these two countries to the rest of the world. Some countries, unable to resolve the economic contradictions and facing a helpless situation, may resort to war to shift the crisis and internal conflicts. At that point, the world may not only witness conflicts like the Russo-Ukrainian conflict or the Israeli-Palestinian war but could potentially see warfare spreading globally.
We have a mission and responsibility to mitigate this crisis through peaceful evolution, transcending the economic downturn. Technology is not inherently guilty, nor are tools or people. Everything depends on how tools are used and how people are mobilized to confront this crisis together. To address this, we propose an economic development theory applicable to the fourth industrial revolution as a reference for an evolutionary approach. However, before elaborating on the theory, let us speculate on the potential future development of AI robots.

2.AI Robots and Productivity
On December 13, 2021, Tesla launched version 10.6.1Beta of its fully automated FSD software. In October 2022, Tesla CEO Musk initiated AI Day 2022, and the humanoid robot Optimus prototype made its debut. Tesla demonstrated the use of humanoid robots in car factories for transportation, watering plants, and moving metal bars. On November 30, 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, capable of generating responses based on patterns and statistical regularities seen during pre-training, engaging in chat interactions akin to humans, completing tasks like writing papers, emails, scripts, copywriting, translation, and coding. On February 19, 2024, Sora achieved video generation through text, marking a significant milestone toward AGI for AI robots. AI robots have begun commercializing in fields such as autonomous driving, image generation, delivery robots, and intelligent voice, entering people's daily lives. It is essential not to underestimate the role of AI robots and to avoid simplistic conclusions that this is merely a method of exhaustive enumeration. This is an extremely naive and thoughtless conclusion.
AI robots consist of two parts: AI brains and mechanical hardware. When AI brains exist alone, they can achieve software-level super automation, such as data processing, content generation, program writing, and the execution of multiple program logics. When AI brains are combined with mechanical hardware, they can replace part of human cognition, such as visual perception, limb movement, language expression, and logical thinking. The development of AI robots mirrors the growth process of humans, progressing from initial visual perception and decision-making, language cognition and decision-making, limb cognition and decision-making, to the integration of visual, language, and cognitive functions, allowing judgments of targets through vision, communication through language, and performing various actions through limbs. Once AI robots master these skills proficiently, they can begin learning to mimic human labor, such as folding clothes, transporting goods, and delivering messages. Through learning and training in multiple single-step behaviors, AI robots will soon master highly complex labor tasks, such as cooking, farming, and serving humans.
The development of AI robots will gradually evolve into super production tools, entering human life from various fields, enhancing human labor efficiency. However, this learning process is also the process of gradually increasing the productivity of the bourgeoisie and replacing labor.

3.AI Robots and Unemployment
The process by which AI robots gain more capabilities through learning and training is also the process of gradually displacing labor. Labor unemployment will gradually expand from voice customer service, designers, and automobile drivers to various industries. The core characteristic here is that positions with increasingly singular discipline knowledge and higher repetition in labor tasks will be the first to be replaced by AI robots.
These positions are precisely the occupations of a large number of proletarians, and many groups originally defined as middle class may also descend into the proletariat due to job loss. Therefore, it is foreseeable that the future proletariat will become increasingly large. The expansion of the unemployed population and the decrease in proletarian income will greatly inhibit consumer demand, exacerbating the problem of overproduction. Enterprises using AI robots for production labor not only reduce costs but also exacerbate overcapacity.
Some theories of social development mention that people have a self-regulating effect. Even if they become unemployed, they will learn other knowledge to master a skill and re-employment. The development of AI in the process will also generate new occupations to absorb labor. However, one thing remains unchanged: the capitalist system of enterprises determines that by improving production efficiency and reducing costs, society as a whole will inevitably use less labor while doing more work, leading to a group of labor unable to find suitable jobs. In addition to this, there are other issues such as the time required for labor to learn new skills and the mismatch between the skills possessed by labor and the abilities required for new positions, indicating that it will take a considerable amount of time for unemployed labor to accumulate and regain employment. Therefore, if the government does not restrict the use of AI robots by private enterprises, it will accelerate the exacerbation of social contradictions and the advent of economic crises.

4.Peaceful Evolutionary Approach
The core elements constituting this world are human society and the material world. Individuals make up society, while the earth and ecology constitute the material world familiar to humans. The process of human development constantly satisfies its own needs, expanding from material needs to spiritual needs. The way to meet one's own needs is to develop productivity, acting on the material world. The key to developing productivity lies in the recognition and application of the objective laws of the material world.

Conversely, every discovery and application of the laws of the objective world drives the development of productivity, enhances humanity's ability to satisfy its own needs, and promotes the evolution of social systems. There are three core trends in the evolution of social systems: the increasing ability of humanity to transform and understand the world, the invention of new tools, and the continuous improvement of social productivity. With the improvement of productivity, more and more people in human society satisfy their material needs and begin to pursue spiritual needs. As the majority satisfy their material needs, cognition begins to awaken, and society shifts from a minority holding power to a majority sharing power. This is the natural law of human social development.

Given the trend of social system evolution and the current global downward debt cycle, the world is in a period of industrial revolution transformation. We hope that the world can resolve this crisis through peaceful evolutionary means, rather than causing the world's people to face disasters through war again. We propose three economic systems to reduce wealth disparity, resolve overcapacity, and improve overall social productivity to expand the overall economic strength of society, allowing countries to transition and transform smoothly.

The first is the development of a large public industrial system, which involves public ownership in areas of people's lives such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, absorbing the labor force of society and satisfying material needs for the grassroots through exchange coupons. This method reduces the circulation of capital in the private sector of people's livelihoods and has a squeezing effect on the private ownership affecting people's livelihoods. The grassroots obtain clothing, food, housing, and transportation products with little labor expenditure, which allows them more surplus income for consumption, thereby driving the purchase of mid-to-high-end goods, resolving overcapacity in enterprises. The key to the practical implementation of the large public industrial system lies in the use of AI robots to replace human production labor, improve production efficiency, supervise the entire process with blockchain technology to reduce the occurrence of corruption in public ownership.
The second is the decentralization of proletarian production materials, with the state developing AI robots in various aspects of society, specifically to implement production activities at the household level. The proletariat can improve their productivity through the use of AI robots, gaining the ability to acquire more wealth. This system absorbs a large number of unemployed laborers, allowing the proletariat to have more wealth for consuming mid-to-high-end goods, promoting the rational operation of social assets.
The third is the restriction of private ownership of AI robots, which can cause mass unemployment among the proletariat. However, one cannot enforce a blanket restriction, as this would hinder the development speed of AI robots.
This evolutionary approach to a certain extent avoids directly weakening the bourgeoisie. Direct weakening methods may lead to war risks in irreconcilable situations. Through the above two development methods, we can truly reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, resolve class contradictions, promote the flow of social capital, resolve overcapacity, and implement a series of policies. I believe the world can evolve peacefully and promote the progress of social systems.


5.Public Ownership of Large Industrial Systems
The public ownership of large industrial systems is divided into two structures based on the importance of industries. The first involves industries crucial to national security such as banking, finance, electricity, energy, mining, safety, and water resources. These require the establishment of large industrial systems based on state-owned capital, where the state holds ownership, distribution, and administrative rights. Private enterprises cannot dominate any essential aspect of industries related to national security. The second structure includes industries related to people's livelihoods, such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, clothing and textiles, light industry, food, construction materials, and transportation. These industries operate under a system where state and collective ownership prevail, with private ownership playing a supplementary role. The state and collectives hold major ownership and distribution rights and partial administrative rights, while individuals hold major administrative rights and partial ownership and distribution rights. This system is not based on egalitarianism or management by factory directors but allows for the full expression of individual subjective initiative within the context of state and collective ownership, emphasizing shared distribution and responsibility in public ownership enterprises.
Private enterprises aim for profit and capital accumulation, while public ownership enterprises aim to expand collective profits and distribute labor income collectively. Different ownership structures have their own advantages. It is inaccurate to stereotype private ownership as efficient and public ownership as inefficient. Under systematic and rigorous organization, public ownership demonstrates higher enthusiasm and resilience than private ownership. With advancements in monitoring and verification methods compared to half a century ago, public ownership systems utilize AI robots to enhance production efficiency. Abundant material resources reduce the prices of essential goods, thus lowering the cost of living. State capital allocation allows dividends to be converted into material products, and targeted poverty alleviation efforts raise the living standards of the lower social strata. Due to different profit objectives and larger scale, public ownership enterprises gain a competitive edge in the market, leading to a crowding-out effect on private enterprises. As private enterprises retract from people's livelihood sectors to maintain profitability by transitioning to high-tech fields, the proportion of public ownership in the economy increases while private ownership decreases.
Given that state-owned sectors monopolize areas crucial to national security and do not engage in market competition, collective economies under the public ownership of large industrial systems become the main force against private-owned economies. If collective economic distribution follows egalitarian principles, it fails to motivate employee enthusiasm. Low incomes cannot ensure sustained work within collective economies. If collective economic management lacks ownership and checks and balances, arbitrary decisions and bureaucratic tendencies may arise. If collective economies rely on continuous state subsidies for survival, they become a cancerous tumor, corrupting and undermining the public ownership system. Only when they demonstrate superiority in market competition can collective economies that surpass private-owned enterprises be widely promoted.
In terms of equity structure, state capital can choose to participate in initial financing based on project ratings. Corporate entities of collective economies occupy a portion of private equity, with the rest reserved for collective committees. State capital and collective equity hold dominant positions, while corporate private ownership diminishes as the enterprise expands. However, in reality, corporate entities see continuous profit increases as the enterprise expands. Private ownership exists within public ownership, but its share is relatively small, a structure that greatly motivates collective labor and ensures the integrity of public ownership.
In terms of organizational structure, businesses vary in size and manpower at different stages of development, necessitating constant adjustments based on developmental stages. This includes structures for the initial and mid-early stages. In the initial stage, independent auditing and supervisory boards ensure the execution of planned operations, with the board of directors responsible for critical decisions. In the mid-early stage, as collective economies expand, representatives of state capital, corporate entities, and collective representatives form shareholder meetings to discuss enterprise direction. Internally, rotating CEO teams are established to prevent business deviations and bureaucratic tendencies.

Using the clothing industry as an example, it is a typical labor-intensive industry involving research and design, manufacturing, and brand channel operations. Among these, manufacturing requires the most labor. When AI robots are extensively employed in private-owned enterprises, manufacturing workers are the first to face unemployment as costs decrease, providing private enterprises with cost advantages in market competition. In the public ownership of large industrial systems, AI robots are also essential for enhancing production efficiency; otherwise, they cannot compete with private enterprises in the market. However, public ownership enterprises, with lower profit goals compared to private enterprises, can accommodate more workers. With state capital shares, enterprises can fulfill certain social responsibilities by sharing profits and material products with the proletarian class.

The government can identify target beneficiary groups based on various indicators such as bank deposits, unemployment duration, and social identity relationships. Limited vouchers or social subsidies can be distributed through digital platforms, and people can choose whether to receive them as per their needs. Blockchain technology records information nodes, and AI technology and auditing ensure policy effectiveness.


6.Transfer of Means of Production to the Proletariat
The transfer of means of production to the proletariat involves the national-level development and manufacture of AI robots for use in household production labor. These AI robots are then leased or provided to the proletariat, allowing them to increase productivity and consequently earn more income. AI robots primarily focus on areas related to people's livelihoods to meet the basic material needs of the populace.

Taking agricultural labor as an example in rural areas, the state limits large-scale land acquisition by private enterprises for production purposes and instead establishes a public ownership system of large industries while transferring AI robots to farmers. This enables the state to acquire more grain at the national level, ensuring national food security. At the farmer level, the use of AI robots increases agricultural productivity and income from farming, promoting the development of public ownership, narrowing the wealth gap, and alleviating social conflicts. Historically, the proletariat has suffered from poverty-induced hunger, while the bourgeoisie has disposed of surplus milk to alleviate oversupply and excess capacity. Such tragedies should not continue.

In urban areas, consider the ride-hailing industry: with the improvement in efficiency through autonomous transport, the introduction of one autonomous vehicle to the market means twice the number of traditional ride-hailing drivers become unemployed. By transferring the operation of autonomous vehicles to the proletariat and restricting the entry of private enterprises, the income of the lower strata of society can be maintained, and social conflicts can be alleviated. The state prevents mass unemployment by limiting the entry of private enterprises and promptly sells or contracts autonomous vehicles to the proletariat. The proletariat utilizes autonomous vehicles in cities to meet daily transportation needs, gaining additional income while avoiding unemployment. This policy facilitates downward mobility of social capital, mitigates consumption insufficiency, and weakens overproduction.

The transfer of means of production to the proletariat effectively increases the income of the lower strata of society, alleviates weak consumption, and allows for the resolution of excess production capacity through increased consumer spending, thereby enabling the normal operation of the economy and gradually resolving social crises.

7.Restriction of Private Ownership AI Robots in Livelihood Sectors and Labor Replacement
When AI robots extensively replace labor in livelihood sectors such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, ride-hailing, food delivery, and courier services, which employ a large number of workers, this directly leads to a significant loss of income for the proletariat. As a result, residents' purchasing power further declines, exacerbating overproduction by enterprises. Therefore, at the national level, restrictions should be placed on the entry of private enterprises into livelihood sectors, and measures should be enacted to increase productivity or reduce commodity prices between units in practice or through taxation on the use of AI robots. Meanwhile, the transfer of means of production to the proletariat should be expedited, allowing the proletariat to prioritize the use of AI robots in livelihood sectors and occupy market share as much as possible while improving overall societal production efficiency. This measure can reduce unemployment, increase proletarian income, narrow the wealth gap, and help mitigate crises during periods of societal transition.






8.Interest-Oriented Monolithic Value System
In the process of human society evolving from feudalism to capitalist society, mechanized production equipment was invented, and the means of production shifted from land to production equipment. The party that possessed the means of production gained the ability to accumulate capital, while those without means of production were forced to sell their labor to earn income. Due to the scarcity of production equipment and the principle of human nature to primarily satisfy one's material needs, the bourgeoisie hoped to achieve capital accumulation by exploiting surplus labor value, while the proletariat hoped to accumulate primitive capital through their labor to purchase production equipment. Thus, the entire society formed a monolithic value system oriented toward self-interest.

In capitalist-dominated societies, although governments proclaim freedom and equality for all, the monopoly and scarcity of the means of production create an unequal competitive environment between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The proletariat is compelled to labor, forfeiting their rights to free development, and is forced to sell health and time for survival. Many individuals in society prioritize interest over fairness and justice, material possessions over love, livelihood over personal ideals, work over life and health, and exchange value over emotional value in interpersonal relationships. Consequently, people in capitalist societies become alienated by money and interests, forsaking personal ideals, losing physical health, forgetting religious beliefs, and diluting moral values and human nature.

In such a societal atmosphere, more and more people become accustomed to this way of life, with some even refraining from voicing concerns about the societal values. Goodness, genuine emotions, creativity, and wisdom are suppressed, and the spiritual world gradually becomes impoverished.

9.Diverse Value-Oriented Pluralistic Value System
The core solution to resolving alienation and oppression of human nature is to develop productivity, producing enough material goods to satisfy everyone's material needs. When the majority of society no longer labors solely to sustain their lives and does not have to sell their time day in and day out, people can then elevate from material needs to spiritual ones. With abundant material life, individuals can continue learning beyond adulthood, choose professions based on personal ideals rather than income, and not consider family background when selecting partners for marriage. People no longer sacrifice health for work, nor engage in corruption for personal gain at work, leading to a significant decrease in the crime rate.

People gradually shift from a single-minded interest-oriented perspective to a diverse value-oriented one. When choosing professions, individuals consider if it helps them achieve their ideals; when choosing partners, they consider soul compatibility. In friendships and interpersonal relationships, emotions and personal feelings take precedence over material gain. People evaluate others based on sincerity and kindness rather than wealth and status. Labor is no longer oppressive and exploitative but driven by personal will and social responsibility. Kindness, emotions, creativity, and wisdom are liberated, allowing more individuals to lead fulfilling lives. The societal atmosphere begins to foster civility and harmony, liberating people from the alienation of capitalism.

10.New Viewpoints on Communist Principles
This section presents some contemporary perspectives on certain issues from the 1847 "Principles of Communism" document. Different viewpoints are elaborated upon.

10.1 Issue Fourteen
Question fourteen: What should this new social system be like?
Answer: This new social system must first deprive individuals engaged in industrial and all production sectors of their business rights and transfer the operation of all these production sectors to the entire society. In other words, these production sectors will be operated for the common benefit, under a common plan, and with the participation of all members of society. Consequently, this new social system will abolish competition and replace it with cooperation. As individual operation of industry inevitably leads to private ownership, competition is merely a way for individual private owners to operate industry. Therefore, private ownership must also be abolished and replaced with the common use of all production tools and the distribution of all products according to common agreement, known as common ownership. Abolishing private ownership succinctly summarizes the transformation of the entire social system caused by industrial development. Hence, communists correctly emphasize the abolition of private ownership as their primary demand.
New Perspective: In a communist society, four forms of economy coexist: state-owned economy, collective economy, private economy, and individual economy. The state-owned economy occupies sectors related to national security, such as energy, chemicals, banking and finance, core technology, transportation, and environmental protection. The collective economy encompasses agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, clothing, food, housing, and transportation sectors, gradually expanding into various domains. The private economy accumulates concentrated capital, mainly occupying high-tech sectors. However, the development of private economy should be restricted in domains related to national security and people's livelihoods. The individual economy engages in small-scale production activities to meet household needs. State-owned and collective economies belong to the public sector, aimed at developing productivity and satisfying people's material needs. The individual economy, due to its limited possession of production materials and small economic scale, primarily satisfies household needs and does not negatively impact society as a whole. The private economy, squeezed by the collective economy during the transition to communism, diminishes in significance within society. However, it plays a crucial role in high-tech sectors contributing to social development. The focus of social development lies in meeting the needs of the people, rather than fixating on public or private ownership. When private ownership hinders the development of people's lives, it should be restricted to prevent individual desires from undermining societal needs.

10.2 Issue Sixteen
Question sixteen: Can private ownership be abolished peacefully?
Answer: Hopefully, yes. Communists are certainly the least opposed to such a method. Communists are well aware that any conspiracy is not only useless but harmful. They understand that revolutions cannot be intentionally or whimsically manufactured; revolutions, under various circumstances, are an inevitable result not subject to the will or leadership of individual parties or entire classes. However, they also see that the development of the proletariat in almost all civilized countries is met with violent suppression, prompting enemies of communism to utilize all means to incite revolution. If the oppressed proletariat is eventually driven to revolution, then we communists will defend the cause of the proletariat through action, just as we currently defend it through speech.
New Perspective: Private ownership is a human need. Both collective and public ownership fulfill human needs. The former satisfies individual needs, while the latter satisfies societal needs. In countries ruled by the proletariat, the establishment of collective enterprises may peacefully transition into public ownership, primarily aimed at developing a large industrial system, until the collective economy can compete with private enterprises, paving the way for societal transformation. In countries governed by the bourgeoisie, the government, representing the bourgeoisie, may witness the establishment of public enterprises by the proletariat, exerting pressure on private enterprises. During development, conflicts may arise more readily, necessitating two fundamental conditions for transitioning from capitalism to communist society: firstly, the accumulation of collective economic strength and the establishment of pressure on private economic development in areas related to national security and people's livelihoods; secondly, as capitalism advances, the proletariat's strength grows proportionally, leading to the establishment of proletarian dictatorship to overthrow bourgeois rule and achieve social transformation.

10.3 Issue Seventeen
Question seventeen: Can private ownership be abolished all at once?
Answer: No, it cannot, just as existing productive forces cannot be immediately expanded to the extent necessary to implement public ownership. Therefore, the imminent proletarian revolution can only gradually transform society. Only after creating the necessary amount of production materials can private ownership be abolished.
New Perspective: Private wealth and capital accumulation primarily manifest in the means of production and land. With the accumulation of collective wealth and the establishment of collective ownership, private ownership in key areas related to national security and people's livelihoods should be gradually replaced by collective ownership. For instance, land in China belongs to the people, but agricultural land can be leased for up to 30 years. The state can adjust land rights based on the progress of agricultural technology and the degree of urbanization, shortening the duration of land rights as necessary. The reduction of land rights duration compresses the space for the private sector, effectively limiting land accumulation by individuals or companies and promoting land circulation. Public ownership advances from the countryside to the city, transforming industrial and commercial sectors. Under conditions of collective ownership, businesses can issue shares to the public to encourage investment and broaden social ownership. As production materials and social wealth increase, the scope of public ownership gradually expands, while the private sector decreases, leading to the eventual realization of communism. The establishment of a communist society is not contingent upon the total elimination of private ownership but on the reduction of private ownership's scope, the expansion of public ownership, and the establishment of a societal system of cooperation and common prosperity.


10.4 Question Eighteen
Question Eighteen: What will be the development process of this revolution?
Answer: Refer to Question Eighteen in "Principles of Communism."
New Perspective: AI robots represent the fourth industrial revolution. The transition from the current society to communism requires the use of AI robots to enhance productivity, thus raising the material living standards of all people. However, under capitalism, AI robots are monopolized by the bourgeoisie and cannot fully realize their utility. This means of production should be owned collectively by the proletariat. The transition to communism from the current state involves five stages: the stage where AI robots are controlled by private ownership; the stage where AI robots are controlled by public ownership; the stage where public-owned AI robots dominate, leading to a rapid decline in the prices of material goods; the shift of primary human needs from material to spiritual; and the great unleashing of people's creativity and vitality, leading to rapid development in world technology and culture. The crucial stage is when AI robots are controlled by public ownership. In countries where the proletariat holds power, this goal is achieved by developing a public-owned industrial system and restricting private access. In countries where the bourgeoisie holds power, it involves establishing collective economies to squeeze out private ownership, or overthrowing bourgeois rule when the proletariat holds decisive power.

10.5 Question Twenty-One
Question Twenty-One: What impact will the communist social system have on the family?
Answer: The communist social system will make the relationship between the sexes purely private, with no need for societal intervention. This is achievable because the system abolishes private ownership and educates children socially, thus eliminating the two bases of modern marriage: the dependence of wives on husbands and of children on parents, generated by private ownership. This is also a response to the hypocritical bourgeois outcry about communist communal wives. Communal wives are purely a phenomenon of bourgeois society, exemplified by prostitution today, which is rooted in private ownership and will disappear with its demise. Therefore, communist organization does not practice communal wives; on the contrary, it aims to eradicate them.
New Perspective: With abundant material resources and a communal atmosphere in a socialist society, relationships among parents, elders, and children become truly equal, fostering greater social independence. Everyone has the inherent right to comprehensive freedom for personal development, thus enabling individuals to choose between living together or independently based on their personal desires within the family, where relationships are both intimate and independent.

10.6 Question Twenty-Two
Question Twenty-Two: How will communist organizations treat existing ethnic groups?
Answer: According to the draft of the "Communist Manifesto" regarding ethnicities, the unique characteristics of various ethnic groups, when combined according to the principles of public ownership, will inevitably merge and eventually disappear, much like various hierarchical and class differences vanish due to the abolition of their foundation—private ownership.
New Perspective: While ethnic groups may merge, their distinctive features will not disappear entirely. Differences in ethnic characteristics arise from variations in geographical environments and resource endowments. The overall trend driven by advancements in productivity, transportation, and social systems is increased interaction and a narrowing of differences among ethnic groups. Therefore, while there will be significant amalgamation of ethnicities, each ethnic group will retain its distinctiveness due to geographical and environmental differences.

10.7 Question Twenty-Three
Question Twenty-Three: How will communist organizations treat existing religions?
Answer: According to the "Communist Manifesto," all religions to date are expressions of historical development stages of individual or several ethnic groups. Communism, however, is a stage that renders all existing religions redundant and seeks to eliminate them.
New Perspective: Since their inception, religions worldwide have been altered by ruling classes to suit their needs, resulting in spiritual imprisonment rather than liberation for society. In a communist society, driven by the human quest for spiritual exploration, religions will shed outdated elements not conducive to social progress and those manipulated by ruling classes. Instead, they will integrate and draw upon the collective wisdom of humanity to fulfill their mission of disseminating human wisdom. Religious integration will lead to the genuine propagation of human wisdom, catering to the spiritual needs of communist society.


11.Conclusion
The primary goal at present is to resolve this crisis. A quick but relatively weak measure is to increase taxation on the bourgeoisie and transfer social assets downwards through large-scale infrastructure investments. However, this method has limited coverage and strong side effects. A better approach is to simultaneously accelerate the development of publicly owned AI robots while implementing a large-scale industrial system under public ownership and transferring the means of production to the proletariat. Limiting private enterprises from entering people's livelihood sectors would expedite the downward flow of social capital, expand the overall economic scale, and thereby hedge against risks.
After overcoming this crisis, the sustained focus should be on promoting large-scale public industries and transferring the means of production to the proletariat. This would create a displacement effect of public ownership over private ownership in people's livelihood sectors. Due to profit considerations, private ownership will gradually transition to high-tech fields. The widespread use of AI robots will enhance overall productivity, leading to abundant material resources in people's livelihood sectors and a continuous decline in the prices of necessities. Eventually, even if the majority of society does not participate in material production, they will have sufficient resources. At this point, public ownership will dominate society, and the lower strata will require minimal costs to sustain their livelihoods. People will be liberated from exploitation and oppression, and the universality of the means of production and the approximation of material life will dissolve class antagonisms. However, private ownership will still exist, and people will gradually shift from pursuing material satisfaction to spiritual needs, leading to diverse societal values.
The successful transformation of a country will trigger a global wave of revolution. Various countries will transition to economic systems primarily based on public ownership, abolishing indoctrination education and religious shackles. People worldwide will experience cognitive elevation and awakening, and religions globally will remove content and expressions that restrict and imprison individuals, instead, serving the spiritual world of humanity as their mission. World religions will begin to integrate, promoting cognitive elevation for all humanity.
The cognitive elevation of all humanity will liberate human thoughts and creativity. World technology and culture will enter a phase of rapid development. Through research and exploration, humanity will discover deeper principles of the world, inventing technological means to explore the universe. People worldwide will turn their gaze toward the cosmos, transitioning from terrestrial civilization to space civilization.
